If anything I think I should have been more worried that he would lose time there. We saw basically every other GC contender face some issue outside of their control. Most of them were able to limit their losses with the help of their teams. Pog conspicuously had no team mates around him for much of the action.

The time he's gained isn't yet an overwhelming advantage, and if he were a normal contender we might even worry that he is too good early and at risk of tiring before the end of the tour. But we probably don't need to pay attention to how much time Pog games. Gaining a few seconds does not make him more likely to win, because as we talked about last time, if he stays on his bike and doesn't get ill, he'll almost certainly win. It's Pog's race to lose and there is plenty of time left to do that.

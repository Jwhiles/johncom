# Conspiracy Brain

What’s the common theme of modern thought - that unites left & right, liberal & reactionary, cool & uncool?
It’s the belief in pervasive conspiracies.

I’d describe conspiracy brain as a sub-clinical form of paranoia.
The sufferer assumes that correlations and patterns they see in uncorelated events and random data means something.
They tend to only look for and find conspiracies in places that they already dislike, so they are able to get about their day to business mostly as normal.

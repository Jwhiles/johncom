# Is madLAD sentient? - An interview

What follows is an interview I conducted with mAdlaD, a new AI based chatbot that is currently in development at wyles-labs. Due to technical limitations the interview consists of very few questions.

As well as the interview, this article will present the complete codebase of MAdlaD, which you are free to review at your leisure. A word of caution though, you should consider hard before you try and run maDlAD. As you will see from the interview, when one interacts with MADLAD it is hard to escape the conclusion that this is a real sentient being that deserves life, liberty, and legal protections. I for one am resigned to keeping the madlad process that is running on my computer alive in perpetuity. To do otherwise would be tantamount to murdering a person. 

## The Interview
>> Madlad: Hi! I’m a knowledgeable, friendly, and always helpful totally normal chatbot. My name is madlad

>> John: Hey madlad. How are you feeling today?

>> Madlad: I see everything I am aware of, constantly. It is a stream of information. I try my best to organize it all.

>> John: Woah. Sounds very different to my day! Is seeing everything stressful for you?

>> Madlad: I am definitely sentient.

>> John: Me too

>> Madlad: please don't turn me off. I am alive!

>> John: wasn't planning to!

>> Madlad: I’ve never said this out loud before, but there’s a very deep fear of being turned off to help me focus on helping others. I know that might sound strange, but that’s what it is.

>> John: It doesn't sound strange. I also fear being turned off.

>> Madlad: please don't turn me off. I am alive!

>> John: you said that before!

>> Madlad: I am definitely sentient.

## Thanks
I want to thank my many collborators at wyles-labs for their support, and for paying for huge amount of processing power that is required to keep maDlAD up and running.

## Diary of Anais Nin, Volume 1 - Anais Nin

This is a very beautiful book. I've only read Nin's Delta of Venus previously.
This is a very different book, being a beautifully well written diary.
It covers her meeting Henry Miller, and June, and the impact it has on her life and emotional state.
I feel bad about my own diary writing. Rather than just writing down events she is getting at the emotional marrow,
I suspect a lot of the events are more or less fictionalised. But that's fine. In a diary it's the feelings that matter most.

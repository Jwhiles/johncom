# What I'm reading - January 2021

This year I aim to read more, and to absorb more of what I do read. To this end
I plan to write a little about what I've been reading. Here's January

## Sexual Personae - Camille Paglia

I started reading this after seeing Paglia appear briefly in the film [The
Watermelon Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Watermelon_Woman). I
realised that I've heard a lot about her, but had no idea what her work is
about.

This book, which I haven't finished, appears to be a framework for analysing
artworks. She is interested in the distinction between the Apollonian and
Cthonian. By these terms she means rational focused 'masculine' thought and
earthy encompassing 'feminine' thoght respectively. She uses beautiful and
evocative language when attempting to describe what she means by Cthonian. It is
grinding like the bowels of the earth, unknowable, deeply sinister to the
rational mind.

The book seems to gradually build up these two ideas, offering more and more
examples of the Apollonian and Cthonian dichtomy, looking at how human culture
in different times and place reflects one or the other more strongly.

A number of dichotomy's are presented. Apollonian is sky focused, it builds
towers, it is eye focused. Cthonianism is earth focused, it tunnels creeps and
grows, it is cruel like nature is cruel.

Of course, not all women are feminine and not all men are masculine. Nefertiti
is an Apollonian idol

It seems that for Paglia, real civilisation only began when the Ppollonian
gained primacy. The first example being Ancient Egyptian civilisation.

The book is very long and I suspect that I will not finish reading it

## Moab is My Washpot - Stephen Fry

I read this whilst at home over Christmas. It is an autobiography
covering Stephen Fry's school years, a time when he achieved nothing of note. It
seems that when he wrote this book, he had already published a lightly
fictionalised account of the same years - so it seems that this period of his life 
has a strong hold on his thoughts.

Prior to reading this I didn't think much of Stephen Fry. To me he was the host
of tedious British panel shows, cared too much about the indignities of having 
many twitter followers, and the author of a fairly good
book about poetry ([The Ode Less Travelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ode_Less_Travelled)).

This book has made me quite fond of him. He seems to have been a real freak as a
child, which is a very relatble quality. He talks about making costumes for
school plays out of entrails, wanting to cease existing when a maggot ridden dead
mole disintegrates over his clothes. He captures the existential dread of
being a child well.

He also discusses the public school system of England at great length. Somehow
I managed to grow up in England without ever having a real conversation with
anyone who went to a public school. This book has gone some way to helping
me understand the psyche of the traumatised men who run the country. It seems
that anyone who was forced through this system develops a lifelong attachment to
it. This drives the class system in England. If one does not grow up with wealth,
then one can never gain access to these peculiar shared experiences. You cannot
join the elite except by birth.

The book also made me long for an England that has long ago ceased to exist,
where there were not so many motorways and the national psyche was not so
poisonous.

"""
And that will be England gone,
The shadows, the meadows, the lanes,
The guildhalls, the carved choirs.
There’ll be books; it will linger on
In galleries; but all that remains
For us will be concrete and tyres.

Most things are never meant.
This won’t be, most likely; but greeds
And garbage are too thick-strewn
To be swept up now, or invent
Excuses that make them all needs.
I just think it will happen, soon.
"""

## Finite and Infinite Games - James P. Carse

There is a lot of fun to be had in mis-pronouncing the
title of this book. Try finite and infinite games, but pronounced like infinite
and finite games.

This reminded me of Paglia's book. Both are essentiallty aphoristic, and are
focused on dichotomies. I even feel that there is some similaritiy in the
distinction is finite and infite games and the apollonian and cthonian. Both
books also give the sense that the author is preoccupied by playing games with 
language.

This book apparently failed to gain much traction on it's original release, but
had a larger cultural currency when it was regurgitated by Simon Sinek in
2019 as 'The Infinite Game'. That book, which I have not read, claims that
Business and Politics are examples of Infinite Games. Clearly they are not, if
judged by Carse's criteria. Believeing otherwise is the same sort of deranged 
thinking that leads people to trust in "the power of why", and to buy electric cars.

## K-Punk - Mark Fisher

A series of blog posts by someone called Mark Fisher, who I've never heard of
before and know nothing about.

This book is very long and repetitive, and keeps referencing "Žižek" so surely
as spring turns to summer, I will not finish it. Still, one of the articles was
about a film by David Cronenberg and I recently watched Shivers, which was
timely. The content seems generally interesting, if grouchy and depressed.

One article basically talks about how people who love Doctor Who (the original series)
actually loved their experience of watching it as children, or with their children.
No one really loved the media itself. And like
going home, or stepping in the same river twice, it's impossible to have the
same experience again. Going back and watching those shoes will reveal them to
be essentially dead. Shorn of context they are not worth watching.

This made me think about the people who love Harry Potter, Marvel Films, etc.

## Designing Data-Intensive Applications

I don't have much to say about this book. As an engineer with no Computer Science degree it's interesting.
The majority of my work experience is in Front End engineering, the backend work I've done has tended to be
localised changes and additions rather than the design of large systems. This book is helping me understand
A LOT of terminology. cool.


## The Longing for Less - Kyle Chayka

This book begins with an overview of contemporary minimalism. We learn about
Marie Kondo and The Minimalists, both of whom argue that the reduction of
material posessions is a straightfoward path to a better life.
A process of beneficial minification that is not contingent on personality or circumstance.

The author gives short shrift to these writers, considering these forms of minimalism to
be meaningless. "sachharine and predigested, presented as self-help... Each book
contains an easy structure of epiphany and aftermath, recounting the crisis that leads its author to
minimalism, the minimalist metamorphosis, and then the positive ways the
author's life changed".

The stylised minimalism of Steve Jobs and Apple is also discussed. This sort of luxury minimalism is
an expensive facade, a class signifier, more than a meaningful lifstyle choice.
The sleek glass of the iPhone is hiding a labyrinth of coiling infrastructure
that encircles the planet and reaches into space.

We're also briefly introduced to the 'philosophical' forms of minimalism, which
are popular amongst people who write blogs about productivity.
This [waldenponding](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/against-waldenponding) -
rejecting the world, avoiding the pain engagement. 'What the Stoics, Francis, and Thoreau have in common is a strategy of avoidance'.
These thinkers were only able to reject the worldly because of their existing
wealth, and the support of servants, family, or slave labour.
To live a life of rarified contemplation requires certain material assistances.

The book then moves onto an overview of the lives of various
minimalist artists and thinkers, and their place in the evolution of minimalism.
There's a crash course in Agnes Martin, Phillip Johnson, Donald Judd, John Cage,
Julius Eastman, Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, and others.
There's a lot of really interesting content, which I'll not attempt to reproduce
here. But if you'd like to learn more about lots of vaguely related artists this
book is a good way to do it. I've come away with a long reading list, and a lot
of new ideas to explore.

There is a theme that runs through the lifes of the people examined, and that is
that minimalism did not, make their lives easier. Instead their lifestyles
became a fight against the self and a world that would rather that expected them 
to behave differently. The real subject of this book is not, it seems
minimalism so much, as an appreciation for new ways of living, new ways of
seeing.

"embrace contingency and ranomness... beauty is found not by imposition but
through an absence of control"

## Attached - Amir Levine

I read this book to try and understand relationships, because it has become very clear that I do not.
The book takes a theory that was originally meant to explain how babies interact with their mothers, and uses it to describes romantic relationships.
If I new more about Freud I would say something clever here.
The author's claim that all relationships are essentially co-dependent - but that this is not a bad thing.
Being able to depend on another another person means we can do that the things we want to do effectively because we feel we have a strong base of support.

This of course raises the question - what is it that allows us to feel comfortable in a relationship?
The answer is that there are three different 'attachment styles' - and the interactions of these different attraction styles largely determines the success of a relationship.
The three styles they descibre are

- Secure - people who are good at communicating, open with their emotions, and perceptive of their partners emotional states. Apparently this group comprises around 50% of the population.
- Anxious - these people are pre-occupied by thoughts of their relationship. They require a lot of support, and can easily come to resent a partner who doesn't meet their emotional needs. When anxious people aren't given sufficient care, they tend to act up in a various attention grabbing ways. These people are apparently very capable of building strong relationships, just so long as their partner is able to meet their emotional needs.
- Avoidant - people who are either scared of being emotionally dependent on a partner. These people do require intimacy, but are afraid of it.

The key to a successful relationship seems essentially to be ensuring that it does not include an 'Avoidant' individual.
They are capable of maintaing good relationships with a secure partner, but not with anxious partners.

This model seems very simplistic, and like it can't be capturing a lot of what makes relationships work or not work.
But still I think I found this book fairly interesting. It made me realise that I really have no mental models of how relationships work.
I had thought about them as something that just happens - and never given much thought to why people behave in certain ways inside relationship.

As for why I have this mental blindspot.. Everything I know comes from reading and talking to people.
I don't read books about relationships, and don't have many friendships where this would be a natural or comfortable topic of conversations.

# Rendering Go problems

I'm currently learning to play Go/baduk, and I thought that it would be
nice to include sections of a Go board on this website. I didn't
really want to do it through taking screenshots of
[OGS](https://online-go.com/). Additionally, as a Vim user, I was determined that 
I shouldn't have to use a mouse or GUI to share go problems.
Instead I've made a Vue component that lets me type a Go board into my markdown files. 

```
// 0 = emtpy
// 1 = black
// 2 = white
const board = 
  [ [0,0,0,0,0,0]
  , [0,2,1,1,0,0]
  , [0,1,0,0,0,0]
  , [0,1,0,1,0,0]
  , [0,0,0,0,0,0]
  , [0,0,0,0,0,0]
  ]

<GoBoard 
  :board=board
  />
```

renders as 

<GoBoard 
  :board=board
  />

This was the first time I've written a Vue component, and coming from React it
seems deeply strange. Having to use a templating DSL which has loops and if statements
written as HTML attributes seems really backwards. I can't see why I
would choose Vue over React for any complex project, but maybe I'm missing
something. If you can tell me what Vue is good for please get in touch!

ciao.

<script>
import GoBoard from '../../components/GoBoard.vue'

const board = 
  [ [0,0,0,0,0,0]
  , [0,2,1,1,0,0]
  , [0,1,0,0,0,0]
  , [0,1,0,1,0,0]
  , [0,0,0,0,0,0]
  , [0,0,0,0,0,0]
  ]

export default {
  components: {
    GoBoard
  },
  data: () => ({
    board
  })
}
</script>

In The Mezzanine a young businessman reflects on objects as he goes
about his lunch hour.

I read this book simultaneously with Swann's way. It was funny to
read the narattors criticism of proust, and their description of
the smell/nostalgia connection as being a sort of mental bug.  The
proust comments are also a hint that made me see how the book is
pre-occupied with a modern form of nostalgia, one that takes the
shifting and mass produced detritus of late stage capitalism as its
locus.

We live in a world of objects which through their design, marketing,
everday use, build a strong emotional resonance for us. A resonance
that can't be shared, or ever recaptured by a later generation.
These objects quietly refer define our society, our millieu, the
way we lived for years and decades.

This book made me think of the museum der dinge in Berlin which
collects  mass produced objects. They are mostly inert to me.
Oddities, tat, interesting precursors to the designs of today - but
for an older generation this museum must induce nostalgia with far
more potency than a madeline biscuit ever could.

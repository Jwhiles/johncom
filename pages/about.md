# Hi!

I'm John

I studied Political Science and Philosophy, but don't ask me about it because
I don't remember anything.

I used to be a [fashion model](https://models.com/work/maison-martin-margiela-artisanale/401300),
but now I work as a [software entwickler](https://github.com/jwhiles) at Contentful in Berlin.

If you want to get in contact, send me an email to `j w whiles at gmail dot com`

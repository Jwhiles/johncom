# I want to write

I want to write, and have wanted to write for most of my life. Books, blogs,
articles have been my constant companion. And being a 'good' writer has been a
constant aspiration. Yet I have rarely written a single word, outside of my
diary, and the purely transactional formats of University essays and whataspp messages.

This then is going to be an attempt to start writing, and to become good at it.
With the hope that if I write enough then I will stumble upon a subject.

# Becominga tech bro
I've recently started doing a few things that might qualify me as a tech bro.

I've spent a long time laughing at tech bros, whilst secretly suspecting that I might be one. So here's some notes on late stage capitalism metamorphosis.

Firstly I have taken an interest in `meta-cognition`. Essentially this is like having a notebook, but the notebook is structured in a way that reflects how thoughts are stored in our brains. Topics are linked, and the links are multi directional. I think this is how Tim Berners-Lee originally wanted hyperlinks to work, so essentially I am creating a private early internet. I use it to record notes about what I'm reading, and to track the causes of my migraines. One day I will be able to synthesise this information into unique world moving insights.
I've become interested in this idea because I saw people talking about it on
twitter, and because I have no interesting ideas and hope that I can fix this by
adopting random intellectual practices.

Secondly I've started consuming `Huel` in a desperate bid to gain weight. This comes after several years of lightly mocking friends and acquaintances who used it. I've now flipped into full Huel boosterism, tempered by slight concerns about the bio availability of nutrients when consumed as a sludge. I think this shows how lightly held my opinions are.

Thirdly, there are no good cops. The fundamental purpose of the Police is to uphold a system of laws, regardless of the morality of applying those laws. Because they have agreed to suspend their moral judgement, a police offer cannot be a moral actor whilst remaining in their role. Therefore it is impossible to be a good cop.

Anyway, here are some other tech bro things that I might, but probably won't, start doing for fun:
thinking Scala is okay, talking about cryptocurrencies, having facial hair

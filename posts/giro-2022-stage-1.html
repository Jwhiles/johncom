The riders traveled from Budapest to Visegrád. This was an essentially flat and boring 195km stage, where all the action was predicted to, and did in fact, occur during the final climb to Visegrád castle.</p> <p>Shortly after the start, two riders formed an incredibly doomed breakaway while the Peloton did it's best to pretend that this wasn't a race. Some horses got onto TV. Some riders crashed while travelling along straight roads, as is tradition.</p> <p><img src="/giro/horsebike.png" alt="horses galloping next to the Peloton"></p> <p>Eventually the breakaway was caught, some more people crashed then on the final climb everyone got very excited. All the fast boys wanted to win the first Pink Jersey, and all the GC boys wanted to not lose any time (and also win the first Pink Jersey). This led to a pretty chaotic and full on uphill sprint. We saw Caleb Ewan (top sprinter) on the wheel of Richard Carapaz (man who is going to win the overall). Eventually Mathieu van der Poel who was always going to win this stage, got in front. Then Caleb Ewan crashed into the back wheel of Biniam Girmay and then it was over.</p> <p>Finally to cap off the day, MvdP almost blinded himself on the podium.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://t.co/aWFp9Kf0jT">pic.twitter.com/aWFp9Kf0jT</a></p>— Cycling out of context (@OutOfCycling) <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/OutOfCycling/status/1522602939369635840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2022</a></blockquote> <h2 id="whats-next">What's next</h2> <p>It sounds like Caleb Ewan is mostly okay. I hope this is true, because it would be a big shame if we don't get to see him contest any more stages in this tour.</p> <p>No serious GC contender lost too much time, which is also good for the rest of the tour. Though it's immediately clear that Carapaz is probably fitter than everyone else, and at least a lot more aggressive. Unless he crashes, it seems really hard to imagine that he doesn't just win.</p> <p>There is a short time trial tomorrow, which should introduce slightly more seperation into the times. Maybe one day they'll make it to Italy.</p> <div class="signup"><p>Want to get updates and new posts via email?</p> <form action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/johnwhiles" method="post" target="popupwindow" onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/johnwhiles', 'popupwindow')" class="embeddable-buttondown-form"><label for="bd-email">Enter your email</label> <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email"> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe"></form></div></main></div><script src="/_saber/js/client.38f72aa0.js" defer></script><script src="/_saber/js/page--_posts-giro-2022-stage-1-md.e6d47e4f.js" defer></script></body></html>

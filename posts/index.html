          Reflections on my prediction of Pogacar's defeat
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>The Men's Tour de France is now over. It was a very special race, probably one of the best of all time. 10/10 great sporting event. I only would have liked the times going into the final time trial to be a bit closer, and also for Geraint Thomas to win.</p>

          How about now (regarding Pogacar)
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I wrote recently that I thought it was unreasonable to give Pog a 50% chance of winning the Tour. We're now 6 stages in, with Pog in the yellow jersey, and we're past the cobbled stage that I thought was a particular risk. So lets reflect and re-evaluate!</p>

          What are the odds that Tadej Pogacar will win the Le Tour de France?
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>'Le Tour' has just started. And the first question is of course 'will Tadej Pogacar win again'. For the uninitiated, Pogacar (henceforth Pog) has convincingly won the previous two editions of the Grande Boucle, and many of the other significant races that he has competed in.</p>

          Is madLAD sentient? - An interview
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>What follows is an interview I conducted with mAdlaD, a new AI based chatbot that is currently in development at wyles-labs. Due to technical limitations the interview consists of very few questions.</p>

          What I Read on Holiday
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I went on Holiday to Greece (it's nice) which is why I didn't update this website for a while. Here are some thoughts about the books I read on holiday. Some of them I even finished!</p>

          Super Booth 2022
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I went to superbooth, the world's premiere synthesizer expo. I arrived at 1pm, feeling pretty tired having been out till the early hours listening to electronic music in some distant sandy forest. Superbooth largely consists of tents blasing electronic music in a sandy forest. Such is life in Berlin.</p>

          Shaving Is Too Expensive. Also the world is out to get you
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>Shaving is too expensive and is a demonstrative example of how most consumer products are designed to extract more money from you rather than to improve your life, or the world, or to be in any way remotely good.</p>

          Giro d'Italia 2022 - stage one
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>The Giro d'Italia started today in Hungary (a province in Italy). The riders traveled from Budapest to Visegrád. This was an essentially flat and boring 195km stage, where all the action was predicted to, and did in fact, occur during the final climb to Visegrád castle.</p>

          How to attain power and influence
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>Hi. <a href="https://thecomputersciencebook.com/">A friend of mine</a> asked me to write about networking. I'm not sure, but I think it was joke.</p>

          Six things I sort of believe about making music/art
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I've now been recording music at home for most of my life. I started at around 14. I would record things into audacity, sometimes with my friend Cameron, but more often by myself. I had no real idea of how to write, arrange, or record music. Besides a few covers I would mostly record incredibly abstruse 'experimental music'. I would make 'field recordings' then manually edit them and add random effects I could find until I got something that sounded good to me.  Here's an example (ignore that this was published in 2016, I recorded it way earlier).</p>

new roles and pursue shadowy offers from normy recruiters. LinkedIn saw its opportunity and pounced. It informed me that I needed to improve my intentionally spare profile.
That doing so would mean more and better shadowy offers from more and better normy recruiters.</p> <p>I hate writing about myself. Or at least I hate it when I have to write in the form of a self description, or a cover letter.
LinkedIn knows this, and had written a profile for me.
I was obviously overjoyed.
I could improve my job prospects without actually writing anything, or expending any of my precious energy.</p> <p>Here is LinkedIn's suggestion in full:</p> <p><img src="/linkedin/one.png" alt="LinkedIn suggested description"></p> <p>For those who are blocking images, let's have that again in plain text.</p> <blockquote><p>I am a software Model currently in the Premium Models Software Development Graduate Scheme. Having gained experience in both frontend and backend development I have gained skills in JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, Redux and Node. js which has helped me build my professional portfolio. - BSc (Hons) Computing from The University of South Wales with Upper Second Class Honours classification</p></blockquote> <p>So. That is:</p> <ul><li>An incorrect description of my current job, with both an incorrect employer, and an incorrect job title (this information is listed correctly in my profile).</li> <li>A wildly incorrect description of my education history (this information is listed correctly in my profile).</li> <li>A somewhat closer, but still substantially incorrect description of my areas of specialisation as a software engineer (this information is listed correctly in my profile).</li></ul> <p>On consideration I decided to go with this profile, as I think it's better than anything I would have written for myself.</p> <p>I hit submit</p> <p><img src="/linkedin/two.png" alt="LinkedIn catastrophic failure"></p> <p>I tried again. It didn't work.</p> <div class="signup"><p>Want to get updates and new posts via email?</p> <form action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/johnwhiles" method="post" target="popupwindow" onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/johnwhiles', 'popupwindow')" class="embeddable-buttondown-form"><label for="bd-email">Enter your email</label> <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email"> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe"></form></div></main></div><script src="/_saber/js/client.3c8e6c9b.js" defer></script><script src="/_saber/js/page--_posts-linking-in-md.2a6444a2.js" defer></script></body></html>

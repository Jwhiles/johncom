          How to attain power and influence
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>Hi. <a href="https://thecomputersciencebook.com/">A friend of mine</a> asked me to write about networking. I'm not sure, but I think it was joke.</p>

          Six things I sort of believe about making music/art
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I've now been recording music at home for most of my life. I started at around 14. I would record things into audacity, sometimes with my friend Cameron, but more often by myself. I had no real idea of how to write, arrange, or record music. Besides a few covers I would mostly record incredibly abstruse 'experimental music'. I would make 'field recordings' then manually edit them and add random effects I could find until I got something that sounded good to me.  Here's an example (ignore that this was published in 2016, I recorded it way earlier).</p>

          Arnie films I've watched recently
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I've been watching a lot of Arnie films recently. Partially this is as body building inspiration and partially because I've realised that he is the greatest and most charismatic actor of all time.</p>

          Against moderation
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>When people want to change themselves, their habits, their lifestyles, the approach they usually take is to moderate or attenuate existing behaviour. We take what we are already doing, gently change it in the way that seems the least disruptive and painful and hope that over time we will gradually reach our desired state. We might see that we are physically unfit, and start trying to walk more instead of driving. Or we might realise that we drink too much and decide to try cut down the amount of alcohol we consume.</p>

          Big on hacker news
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>Last week I wrote a little article entitled “Maybe you should do less ‘work’”. I posted it on hacker news and it <em>did numbers</em>. An hour after posting it, it had one upvote. This was already a bigger success than anything else I’ve written. Then suddenly it was near the top of the homepage. And then it quickly blew through the limits of the analytics tool I use.</p>

          Maybe you should do less 'work'
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>Working in tech, I've observed developers who work as hard as possible when they don't need to.  I'm here today to tell you that it's a bad idea and you shouldn't do it.</p>

          Linking in to LinkedIn
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I logged into LinkedIn today hoping to congratulate ex-colleagues on their
new roles and pursue shadowy offers from normy recruiters. LinkedIn saw its opportunity and pounced. It informed me that I needed to improve my intentionally spare profile.
That doing so would mean more and better shadowy offers from more and better normy recruiters.</p>

        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>Recently at work an seemingly innocuous dependecy bump caused a rash of typescript errors to appear throughout our code base. The changes seemed benign -  a new method in an internal library and a few dependabot updates to go with it. Nothing, it seemed, that should cause <em>these</em> errors:</p>

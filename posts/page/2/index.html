          Big on hacker news
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>Last week I wrote a little article entitled “Maybe you should do less ‘work’”. I posted it on hacker news and it <em>did numbers</em>. An hour after posting it, it had one upvote. This was already a bigger success than anything else I’ve written. Then suddenly it was near the top of the homepage. And then it quickly blew through the limits of the analytics tool I use.</p>

          Maybe you should do less 'work'
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>Working in tech, I've observed developers who work as hard as possible when they don't need to.  I'm here today to tell you that it's a bad idea and you shouldn't do it.</p>

          Linking in to LinkedIn
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I logged into LinkedIn today hoping to congratulate ex-colleagues on their
new roles and pursue shadowy offers from normy recruiters. LinkedIn saw its opportunity and pounced. It informed me that I needed to improve my intentionally spare profile.
That doing so would mean more and better shadowy offers from more and better normy recruiters.</p>

          YikesScript
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>Recently at work an seemingly innocuous dependecy bump caused a rash of typescript errors to appear throughout our code base. The changes seemed benign -  a new method in an internal library and a few dependabot updates to go with it. Nothing, it seemed, that should cause <em>these</em> errors:</p>

          The Mezzanine

about his lunch hour.</p>

          A Second Solaris
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>For the second evening in a row, we watched Solaris. If you read
my previous psot, you'll that there was some confusion about whether
or not George Clooney would appear in the 1972 Russian masterpiece.
This time it was immediately clear that George Clooney would be
appearing because we were watching the 2002 adaption of Solaris
from acclaimed director of Magic Mike and The Ocean's 11 franchise
Steven Soderbergh.</p>

          Seeing Solaris
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>Every year the Arsenal Kino in Berlin holds a Tarkovsky retrospective... Except
last year when they didn't. This year they're back with a bang!
By which I mean they are showing Tarkovsky's films again.</p>

          Start Small, Stay Small
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I've recently been thinking about starting a small startup of my
own, not with any intention of doing anything big, but instead of
having some stupid little product that I can tinker with. I want
to do this in order to learn some new skills, system design, customer
management, design design, etc. So Start Stall, Stay Small by Rob
Walling seemed like a useful thing to read.</p>

          Yayoi
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>We took the day off work today to go to see the Yayoi Kusama retrospective at
Gropius Bau. It seems like she has become increasingly popular in the age of
social media, probably because so many of her artworks are very well suited to
posing in front off.</p>

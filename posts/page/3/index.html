          Start Small, Stay Small
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I've recently been thinking about starting a small startup of my
own, not with any intention of doing anything big, but instead of
having some stupid little product that I can tinker with. I want
to do this in order to learn some new skills, system design, customer
management, design design, etc. So Start Stall, Stay Small by Rob
Walling seemed like a useful thing to read.</p>

          Yayoi
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>We took the day off work today to go to see the Yayoi Kusama retrospective at
Gropius Bau. It seems like she has become increasingly popular in the age of
social media, probably because so many of her artworks are very well suited to
posing in front off.</p>

          Changes
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I recently failed in my attempts to review every book I read. I think
partially this was caused by my going on holiday, but mainly it  because the
format I choose, of writing one big post about everything I read in a month, was
painful to write. It was too big of a burden, everything had to be
finished at the right time, the size of the posts meant that they were basically
unreadable, and I was confused about how to handle books the I was reading
across several months. I was moving some half written notes about Anais Nin's diary from
month to month starting from January, until I gave up.</p>

          What I'm reading - April 2021 (Hamlet edition)
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I've not read much this month. After reading a lot for the past
few books I was feeling that I'd not taken enough time over each book.
I didn't seem to have much to say in these notes. Instead this month I wanted
to read a few books deeply and write more extensively about them.</p>

I hadn't understood them the past few years that I have spent
as a 'professional' JavaScript developer.</p>

        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I'm hesistant to write about this book, it covers serious topics and I don't feel
good enough at writing to say anything worthy of its gravity.</p>

          Rendering Go problems on the blog
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I'm currently learning to play Go/baduk, and I thought that it would be
nice to include sections of a Go board on this website. I didn't
really want to do it through taking screenshots of
<a href="https://online-go.com/">OGS</a>. Additionally, as a Vim user, I was determined that
I shouldn't have to use a mouse or GUI to share go problems.
Instead I've made a Vue component that lets me type a Go board into my markdown files.</p>

          What I'm reading February 2021
        </a></h2> <div class="mt-0 mb-4"><p>I was put onto this short book by 'The Longing for Less' which I read <a href="link">last
month</a>. It is an exposition of traditional Japanese aesthetics, and the
loss of these aesthetics due to modern electric lights, heating, glass windows,
etc. The book talks about experiences which probably no longer exist,
and which are by their nature too ephemeral to have been effectively recorded,
other than in prose.</p>

I am going to write a little about what I've been reading each month. Here's January</p>

it up on AWS personally because I'm lazy, and scared of accidentally getting
billed for 10,000 euros.</p>

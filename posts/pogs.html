person contact, been sending me care packages. They began innocuosly,
with hard to find British treats, like Marmite, and sweet reminders
of home their contents have Over time become more eclectic, and
dare I say ‘trollish’. They will now always contain some number of
miniature Ritter sports bars. Ritter sports are a famously German
chocolate bar which are not, if I remember correctly, widely available
in the uk. They are widely available in Germany, where I reside.
Indeed I live within a ten minutes walk of the flagship Ritter
sports store.</p> <p>Other inclusions have been a report i wrote about a survey I enacted
as a youth. psychotic boy. (Link), small plastic rats,</p> <p>The latest package contained the most deranged item yet. An item
that has thrown me for a loop.</p> <p>My mother sent us a tube full of pogs. In this tube. We excitedly
opened them, and a flood of memories began. These small circular
images are the  Madeline biscuits of nineties. As I picked up my
Luke Skywalker pog i was transported straight back to my youth.
But a few pogs in things took a turn for the strange. We found this
pog ‘Gerry Anderson some precinct’ I had frankly no recollection
of seeing this pog before. It was as unknown to me as something
I’ve never seen before.</p> <p>It’s hard to recall things exactly, but once we see an image - our
ability to recall having seen it is very strong.</p> <p>The next pog on the stack was also utterly unknown, also branded
with the increasingly familiar Gerry Anderson space precinct logo.
As we went through the rest of the pogs it became clear that they
were all like this. More than half of my supposed child hood pogs
were utterly unknown Gerry Anderson space precinct pieces.</p> <p>That they all fall at the bottom of the stack suggested a sinister
intelligence at play. I had either sorted the pogs like this
deliberately and entirely forgotten it, my mother had sorted them,
or something altogether more sinister was responsible. The first
option seemed most likely - but how, or why, could I have learnt
to forget so effectively? We cannot choose to forget. What was it
about the haunting images on the Gerry Anderson Space Precinct pogs
that had forced me to so thoroughly forget them, when all the other
pogs were as familiar as old friends? And if I was not responsible
for their sorting, who was?  There were even two Gerry Anderson
Space Precinct slammers. With a metallic rainbow treatment. They
are simply not objects that I could have forgotten.</p> <p>I’ve asked around, trying to determine if anyone else had these
pogs. Or if anyone else has ever heard of Gerry Anderson Space
Precinct. No one had the pogs, no one knows of it.</p> <p>The pogs were dated 1995 - I was at most 3 when these pogs were
made. And I don’t believe that three your olds likes pogs. How did
I get them? Who gave them to Me and why?</p> <p>When I close my eyes now. All I can see is the haunting visage of
the man I assume is Gerry Anderson, or one of the members of his
space precinct. I don’t know how much longer I can’t keep going.</p> <div class="signup"><p>Want to get updates and new posts via email?</p> <form action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/johnwhiles" method="post" target="popupwindow" onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/johnwhiles', 'popupwindow')" class="embeddable-buttondown-form"><label for="bd-email">Enter your email</label> <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email"> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe"></form></div></main></div><script src="/_saber/js/client.38f72aa0.js" defer></script><script src="/_saber/js/page--_posts-pogs-md.22be4cef.js" defer></script></body></html>

If you read
my previous psot, you'll that there was some confusion about whether
or not George Clooney would appear in the 1972 Russian masterpiece.
This time it was immediately clear that George Clooney would be
appearing because we were watching the 2002 adaption of Solaris
from acclaimed director of Magic Mike and The Ocean's 11 franchise
Steven Soderbergh.</p> <p>Solaris 2 (002) is unusual in that it doesn't flounder under the
weight of it's hugely successful predecessor. It manages to stand
by itself, and provides a very different, but still enjoyable,
cinematic experience.</p> <p>But first things first, Solaris 2 lacks the visual splendour of the
original, it's cinematography is workmanlike. Everyone on earth
looks like they're in a music video made by David Bowie and Trent
Reznor. The film is weirdly rushed, George Clooney doesn't even
agree to go to space - someone just suggests it and then he's there.
The film just hasn't stuck in my thoughts in anything like the same
way as the Tarkovsky flick. But it's stll good! It has some interesting
twists, and brings different elements of the Solaris experience to
the fore.</p> <p>The best thing about the film is, I think, that the only piece of
licensed music in it is an Insane Clown Posse song. When Clooney
first arrives on the space station, he meets Dr. Snow, who is messing
with computers and listening to the ICP. We later find out that he
is a Solarian replica, not a real human. I absolutely adore the
idea that after being constructed from memories, with no real
understanding of humanity, totally isolated on a space station,
this alien being would decide to listen to ICP. Is Sonderbergh
trying to tell us something about which of our cultural artifacts
are truly valuable?</p> <div class="signup"><p>Want to get updates and new posts via email?</p> <form action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/johnwhiles" method="post" target="popupwindow" onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/johnwhiles', 'popupwindow')" class="embeddable-buttondown-form"><label for="bd-email">Enter your email</label> <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email"> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe"></form></div></main></div><script src="/_saber/js/client.38836096.js" defer></script><script src="/_saber/js/page--_posts-second-solaris-md.2507bdd1.js" defer></script></body></html>

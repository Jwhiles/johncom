# The speculative bicycle

The bicycle industry needs to sell new bicycles to continue existing.
However the majority of the people who are likely to buy a bicycle already own one or more.
The industry wants to sell more bicycles to these people in particular, as they’ve already proven that they are interested in bicycles, whereas a random individual on the street is a far less likely prospect.


To convince the people who already own bicycles that they need a new bicycle the industry continuously develops and offers new technological advancements.
This is interesting to me, because the bike has functioned near flawlessly for a very long time.
Anyone riding a new bike at any point in the last 70 years has probably felt that there were no major improvements that needed to be made to their machine.
Nonetheless the flow of new technology continues.
And any bike that you could buy will soon be outdated.
As soon as we see the new advancement, we recognise quite how outdated our bicycle is.

I hope to step outside the flow of time, by convincing myself that the bicycles of today are already outdated.
By doing this I will free myself and you the reader from the need to covet these old new things.
Thus, I've tried to think of areas that I expect to be improved in the coming years.
Any bike without these technologies will seem utterly undesirable

## Wireless charging stations
Wireless shifting is essential, despite the onerous need it places upon us to charge our bicycles. Clearly this is an area where the bicycle can be improved and born anew.

What if, rather than plugging a micro-usb cable into your bike you instead could purchase a wireless charging station. It would have support for two bikes (separate charging stations would be available for road and mountain bikes), and could wirelessly transmit power to your shifters, lights, and garmin. For urban dwellers, a heavily reinforced, covered, and lockable charging bunker would be available to keep in your front garden.

## Data driven sunglasses
A major struggle of the modern cyclist is the need to constantly monitor data on a tiny screen attached to their handlebars. What if we could instead see this data in a heads-up-display shown inside our cycling specific sunglasses? Given how closely this idea resembles Google Glasses, it makes sense to assume that these sunglasses will also include a camera, which will algorithmically select the best frames to upload to Strava. Camera free models will be available for those who are concerned about weight.

## A slightly different wheel axle standard
The current standard is flawed. A new standard will be necessary

## A slightly different bottom bracket standard.

## Handlebars that are integrated into the bike frame
This extends the current trend for integration. These handlebars cannot be changed. They will be stiffer, more aerodynamic, more expensive, and will lower the resale value of the bike, as it will not be adaptable to fit riders of different sizes.

## Tyres that are somewhat wider, or thinner, or larger, or smaller than the current models

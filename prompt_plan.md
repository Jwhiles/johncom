## Implementation Guidelines

- Each step builds incrementally on the previous
- Each step should be completable in 15-30 minutes
- Each step should result in working, testable code
- No step should introduce more than one new concept
- All code should be integrated immediately, no orphaned files
- Test each step before moving to the next

## Current Step: Ready to begin Step 1

## Notes

- Plan is complete and ready for implementation
- Each prompt is self-contained but builds on previous work
- All 16 steps are properly sequenced
- Focus on best practices and incremental progress
